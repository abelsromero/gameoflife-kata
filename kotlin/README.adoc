= Game of life Kata in Kotlin

Variant of http://codingdojo.org/kata/GameOfLife/ in which the board is generated randomly.
See https://bitstorm.org/gameoflife/ for simulator.

== Approach

. Started creating a board with all dead cells
. Implemented iteration logic on single cases
. Finally implemented board randomizer

== TODO

To be able to create a board from an input like this.

Another companion method in `Board` could be added without much complexity.

== Evolution

In case new types of cells need to be considered.
New types of `Cell` can be easily created thanks to the use of https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/sealed-classes.html[Kotlin sealed classes].
Furthermore, each type of cell could iterate independently just implementing a method like `iterate(neighbours:Int)`.
This would avoid changes in the already convoluted logic of `Board::interate()`.
